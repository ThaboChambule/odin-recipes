     <h2><strong> Description </strong></h2> 
     <p>I love pilchards and feel like they're eaten more in SA than anywhere else in the world.
        Here, I've taken a bit of a risk and made something with them that's similar to tahdig â€“</p> 
        <p>it's like intshela or iskhokho (the crisped up bottom of the pot after preparing pap) 
        and it's delicious, whether you get the shape perfect or not. </p>
