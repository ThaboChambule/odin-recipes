     <h2><strong> Description </strong></h2> 
     <p>I love pilchards and feel like they're eaten more in SA than anywhere else in the world.
        Here, I've taken a bit of a risk and made something with them that's similar to tahdig –</p> 
        <p>it's like intshela or iskhokho (the crisped up bottom of the pot after preparing pap) 
        and it's delicious, whether you get the shape perfect or not. </p>
        
     <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled </li>
        <li> 1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked </li>
        <li> 1 cup white sugar </li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons cornstarch  </li>
        <li> ¾ cup water </li>
        <li> ½ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
    </ul>
     
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan. </li>
        <li> Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  </li>
        <li> Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture  </li>
        <li> Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. </li>
        <li> Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours. </li>
        <li> Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form.  </li>
